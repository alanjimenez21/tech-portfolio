I am currently attending Wake Tech Community College. I began this journey as I am motivated to pursue a Master's in Degree in Computer Science.
So far I have learned several technologies such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and GitHub.

I am currently taking three classes, and I am looking forward for next semesters/
